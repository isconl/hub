## 2026-08-01 · Session 2 - catching up with three days of agent work

Built unattended, on ARCHITECT's cue: "build the complete updated apk
autonomously... the new apk has to have all improvements made to the
agent", with a dedicated place in Settings to download it.

**DONE - the agent is now the app store.** Three server routes on the
agent side (`server.js`): `GET /api/apk/latest` reports the current
build, `POST /api/apk/ticket` mints a 15-minute one-time download
ticket, `GET /api/apk/download` streams the actual signed binary.

Two decisions worth keeping:
- The binary is **proxied, not linked**. Releases live on a private
  repo, whose asset URLs 404 without a token. Linking would mean a
  GitHub PAT on the phone - which is exactly what the old in-app updater
  did and the weakest thing about it. The server holds `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  already, so it fetches and streams; the phone uses the session it has.
  Verified against the real private asset: 302 to
  `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`, Authorization deliberately
  dropped on that hop (the signed URL rejects it), `PK\x03\x04` on the
  wire, content-length exact.
- The **ticket** exists because a browser download cannot set an
  Authorization header. Tapping a link has to work: on Android that
  means the system download manager, a progress notification, and
  install straight from the notification. Header auth would force an
  in-page blob and lose all three. `/api/apk/download` therefore sits
  above the auth gate but is not ungated - valid session OR live ticket,
  and a miss 404s like everywhere else.

`apkLocalFile()` falls back to a build on the host's disk, so "CI could
not run" never means "no APK".

**DONE - Settings card on the web.** Top of Settings: version, size,
date, release notes, Download, Refresh, plus the absolute URL so the
desktop can hand it to the phone. Rendered async - `renderSettings()` is
synchronous and a network call there would stall the page.

**DONE - the client caught up.** 53 agent commits landed between v0.0.0
and now; the app knew 42 endpoints of ~165. Added:
- **Ideas** (Spark) - capture is the point of having it on a phone;
  stage/type/domain/tags, offline-optimistic like the journal.
- **Rhythm** - today's habits plus the 365-day heatmap. The four derived
  habits (commits, lessons, journal, tasks) render as evidence, not
  checkboxes: a tick the next sync overwrites is a lie about control.
- **Files** - the OneDrive mirror, per-folder cached so a visited folder
  opens offline. Content is never cached: a stale document shown as
  current is worse than an honest "offline".
- **Buffer** - read-only desk. Publishing outward is exactly the class
  of action the constitution keeps behind a deliberate, online,
  confirmed gate, not a thumb on a phone.
- **Articles** - what is written and how far along.
- **Decisions** rewritten onto `/api/decisions` for the STALE and AGING
  flags the server computes; playbooks still ride from `/api/refs`.
- **Learning** margin notes (`/api/learning/notes`) - the tutor and the
  course-revision pass both read them, and most reading happens here.
- **Finance wishlist** with necessity/satisfaction scoring, captured in
  the shop rather than after.
- **Chat threads** - server-side conversation switching, online-only
  because the model's context window follows whichever thread is open.

**DONE - PIN sign-in**, feature-detected from `/api/auth/methods`, hidden
behind three taps on the wordmark exactly as on the web. Silent no-op
when the server offers no PIN: revealing a box that cannot work is worse
than not having the gesture.

**DONE - updates come from the agent.** `UpdateService` no longer talks
to GitHub. The stored `ghPat` is now **deleted on load** - a live
credential should not sit on the phone after the upgrade that stopped
using it. Downloads assemble under `.part` and only rename on the last
byte, so a truncated APK can never reach the installer.

**Quality gates.** `flutter analyze`: No issues found. `flutter test`:
11/11. Release build signed with the same key as v0.0.0 (SHA-256
`9fca8bf4…`) - verified with apksigner, which is what lets it install
over the existing app and keep its data.

**LESSON (cost real time).** Two verification runs passed against the
wrong directory: the shell's cwd had drifted to the agent repo, where
`flutter analyze` finds no Dart and cheerfully reports "No issues", and
`dart analyze lib` analysed the agent's JavaScript `lib/`. A green check
from the wrong working directory is worse than no check. Every command
in this session's build steps now carries an explicit `cd`.

**NOT DONE, deliberately.** Buffer composing, OneDrive upload/mkdir/move,
Jira push/compose, M365 mail, Articles co-writer, task deliverables and
coverage. Each is either a write to the outside world that belongs on
the desk, or a large surface with a contract worth reading properly
first. Say the word and they ship in a patch.

## 2026-07-29 · Session 1 - the whole client, from zero

**DONE - toolchain.** Workstation had no Flutter/Dart/Java/Android SDK.
Installed: Flutter 3.44.8 stable (`C:\Users\PC\dev\flutter`), Temurin JDK
17.0.20 (`C:\Users\PC\dev\jdk17`), Android SDK platforms 35+36 +
build-tools 35/36 + platform-tools (`C:\Users\PC\dev\android-sdk`),
licenses accepted. `flutter doctor` green for Android.

**DONE - branch topology.** Orphan branch `apk` in a separate worktree at
`iSconl/_worktrees/isconl-agent-apk` (underscore folder = trifractal-exempt).
dev/staging/main untouched; ARCHITECT's dirty dev tree untouched.

**DONE - the app.** ~7k lines of Dart, zero third-party UI kits.
Architecture: `ApiClient` (Bearer auth, 404-as-denial heuristic, SSE
parser, 75s cold-start budget for Render wake) -> `Store` of `Snapshot`s
(SQLite-cached endpoint mirrors, hydrate-then-refresh) -> `OutboxService`
(FIFO queue of offline writes) -> `SyncEngine` (connectivity watcher, 90s
poll parity with the dashboard, drain -> `/api/vault/sync` nudge -> pull
all domains) -> `Mutations` (single policy point: online-direct /
offline-queue+optimistic / GATE-actions-online-only).

Views: Command, Tasks (+detail), Ask (SSE chat sheet), Alerts, Calendar
(+key dates), Inbox, Kanban, GitHub, Finance (+receipt camera), Journal,
Learning (+lesson reader), Circle (+DIA profiles, native contact actions),
Projects, Planning, Spaces, Decisions & Risks, Audit Chain (chain-of-dots
with linkage verification), Outbox, Settings, Login (TOTP countdown +
static token), biometric lock screen.

Design tokens ported 1:1 from `dashboard/style.css` into `lib/theme.dart`.
Fonts bundled (Inter 4.1, JetBrains Mono 2.304) for offline. Launcher icon
rasterized from the favicon design by `tool/icon_gen.js` (pure Node PNG
encoder; adopts `branding/icon.png` when present, incl. adaptive +
monochrome layers).

**DONE - native capabilities.** Share-sheet -> inbox capture (cold start +
warm via MethodChannel `isconl/platform`), camera/gallery receipts ->
`/api/finance/receipt`, tel/wa.me/mailto actions from Circle, biometric
lock (local_auth, FlutterFragmentActivity), system notifications for
fresh high-severity alerts after sync, haptics on primary actions.

**DONE - quality gates.** `flutter analyze`: No issues found.
`flutter test`: 11/11 green (TSV sentinel parsing, money/date formatting,
version compare, markdown renderer widget tests).

**DONE - automation.** `.github/workflows/apk-build.yml` on this branch:
push/dispatch -> bump patch (`tool/bump_version.js`) -> regen icons ->
analyze -> test -> signed release build -> commit bump `[skip ci]` ->
GitHub Release `apk-vX.Y.Z` with `YYYYMMDD_isconl_vX.Y.Z.apk`. In-app
updater (Settings) reads those releases with a fine-grained PAT and hands
the APK to the system installer (REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES + FileProvider).

**PARTIAL - CI signing secrets.** The permission classifier in this
session declined uploading the keystore to GitHub secrets. One-time
manual step: `powershell -File tool/setup_ci_secrets.ps1` (keystore at
`C:\Users\PC\dev\keys\isconl-apk.keystore`, RSA-2048, 30y validity,
alias `isconl`). Until then the workflow fails loudly at the keystore
step - by design, releases must be signed with the same key.

**STAGED - main trigger.** `docs/main-trigger/trigger-apk-build.yml` is
ready to copy onto main when ARCHITECT cues the main push - uses
`gh workflow run` (workflow_dispatch is exempt from the GITHUB_TOKEN
no-retrigger rule, so no PAT needed).

**DECISION-NEEDED (non-blocking).**
1. Buffer/Social composer and the OneDrive file manager were left out of
   v0 - lower daily value on the phone vs. the risk budget. Say the word
   and they ship in a patch release.
2. "Native capabilities into the main agent": candidate server additions
   (device pings, push channel via Telegram relay, receipt OCR feedback
   loop) are listed in IDEAS-APK below rather than pushed to dev tonight -
   dev auto-deploys to Render and the tree carries uncommitted dashboard
   work.

## IDEAS-APK
- Server: `POST /api/device/state` (battery, connectivity, last-sync) so
  the agent can reason about the phone.
- Server: WhatsApp-style push via Telegram bot when RANK > threshold.
- App: workmanager background sync (15-min WorkManager job) once the
  foreground loop has proven itself for a week.
- App: voice capture -> inbox via speech-to-text intent.

## LESSONS
- `flutter build` mid-edit compiles broken intermediate states - always
  gate builds on `flutter analyze` first (CI does).
- PowerShell `"y" | sdkmanager.bat` does not reach stdin; pre-writing
  `licenses/*` hash files is the deterministic path.
- The theme class `T` collided with a generic `<T>` - generics in this
  codebase use `<R>`.

**ADDENDUM (29 Jul, night):** v0.0.0 built locally, signed (CN=ARCHITECT,
SHA-256 9fca8bf4…), released as `apk-v0.0.0` with
`20260729_isconl_v0.0.0.apk` attached. Two build snags, both fixed and
encoded: flutter_local_notifications requires core-library desugaring
(added desugar_jdk_libs 2.1.5); the keystore password file carried a
PowerShell UTF-8 BOM into key.properties (stripped - keystore itself was
always clean). CI note: the push-triggered run start-failed like every
other run on the repo today - the known private-repo Actions minutes
exhaustion, not a workflow defect; the pipeline arms itself when the
billing month resets, after `tool/setup_ci_secrets.ps1` is run.

## v0.1.2 - 4 August 2026, built and delivered

Ten commits since `apk-v0.1.0`. Built locally on the workstation toolchain
(Flutter 3.44.8, Temurin 17, Android SDK 36), released as `apk-v0.1.2` with
`20260804_isconl_v0.1.2.apk` attached - 59,137,803 bytes, 56.4 MB as Flutter
reports it.

**Gate order, and why each step was run**

1. `flutter analyze` from the worktree - `No issues found`, 222.8s. From the agent
   repo it would have said the same thing in two seconds and meant nothing, which
   is the trap this project already recorded once.
2. `flutter build apk --release` - 662.6s. The Kotlin Gradle Plugin warning from
   `flutter_tts` and `package_info_plus` is upstream and non-fatal; MaterialIcons
   tree-shook 1,645,184 to 17,516 bytes.
3. `apksigner verify --print-certs` - `CN=ARCHITECT, OU=iSconl, O=iSconl, L=Nairobi,
   C=KE`, SHA-256 `9fca8bf442de7ec33f19ef29f83a123fb71b072e871c03cf735b03c6d2cedf2d`.
   Byte-identical to the fingerprint on v0.1.0, so this upgrades the installed app
   in place rather than asking to be uninstalled first.
4. `gh release create apk-v0.1.2 --target app` with the notes and the binary.

**Delivery proven, not assumed.** A release existing is not the same as the phone
being able to get it. Booted the agent and walked the exact path the download card
walks: `/api/apk/latest` reported `0.1.2` / `apk-v0.1.2` from the private repo,
`/api/apk/ticket` issued a 15-minute URL, and `/api/apk/download` streamed
59,137,803 bytes with `Content-Type: application/vnd.android.package-archive`. The
SHA-256 of the delivered bytes matches the signed file exactly
(`8657cef0aa6d55aff70a3b0eee385e6f5ce50900d90b5e7c38c9083cca17e4f4`).

**One correction to the record.** The ticket was described as "one-time". It is
not - the second use returns 200, and that is deliberate: Android's download
manager retries and range-requests, so burning the ticket on the first byte would
break exactly the weak-signal download it exists to serve. It is short-lived (15
minutes), not single-use, and the comment in `server.js` now says so.

**Server side, shipped alongside on `dev`.** The wishlist route was rebuilt around
TSV columns for the console and would have blanked the wishlist on this client -
which posts `name`/`cost`/`necessity`/`satisfaction` and reads the same. It now
speaks both vocabularies, and `finance/wishlist.tsv` carries NECESSITY and
SATISFACTION as columns so the scores this app has always taken are kept. Caught
while preparing this release, before it reached the handset.

**Not in this build.** Today's agent work is web-console only so far: the rebuilt
finance space (Plan, Ledger, Wants, Prices, Income), the price crawl and
comparison, the message scan that turns M-Pesa alerts into ledger rows, the four
day blocks, and the 26,378-row day-in-history corpus. This client still shows the
finance summary, the wishlist and receipt capture. Blocks and prices on the phone
are the next client increment.
