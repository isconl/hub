/// The local module library.
///
/// ARCHITECT reads learning modules on his phone, often with no signal, and a module
/// written to the depth standard is a long read. So the rule he asked for is:
/// **once a module is downloaded it stays downloaded, until the module itself
/// changes.** Not until a cache expires, not until the next sync, not until the
/// app is reinstalled. Until the content moves.
///
/// The body is already cached in SQLite by [Snapshot] - what was missing was any
/// way to know the day it went stale. A client holding a body cannot infer that
/// from the body. So the agent publishes `/api/learning/manifest`: every module
/// with a content revision. This class compares that against what is on the
/// device and answers three questions the UI needs:
///
///   * is this module downloaded?
///   * is the downloaded copy still current?
///   * how much of the course is readable offline right now?
///
/// The revision is a hash of the bytes, not a timestamp. The vault round-trips
/// through OneDrive, so mtimes move without content moving; a timestamp
/// comparison would re-download the whole library after every mirror pass and
/// would still miss an edit that landed with an unchanged clock.
///
/// Nothing here ever evicts. A module leaves the device when ARCHITECT says so
/// ([forget]), not when a policy decides the disk would look tidier.
